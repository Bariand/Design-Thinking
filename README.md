# Design_Thinking
Foursys' Design Thinking Project developed during their Fourcamp course. All brand logos, names, images and information used during this project were used for learning purposes only. I do not own anything.

The first project was developed by groups of five to eight people. The objective was to create a bank app applying design thinking's double diamond methodology. We designed it using the Miro platform and it can be accessed in this link:

The second project I was asked to create by myself and I did it using the Miro platform. The objective was to choose a website and fix some of its alleged problems using a persona as the main focus and applying the double diamond methodology. The project can be accessed clicking the link below:
